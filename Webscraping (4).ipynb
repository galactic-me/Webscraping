This document provides an \\noverview of these ICS and typical system topologies, identifies typical threats and vulnerabilities to these \\nsystems, and provides recommended security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks.', 'Initially, ICS had litt le resemblance to traditional information technology (IT) systems in that ICS were \\nisolated systems running proprietary control protocols using specialized hardware and software.', 'Widely \\navailable, low -cost Internet Protocol (IP) devices are now replacing p roprietary solutions, which increases \\nthe possibility of cybersecurity  vulnerabilities and incidents.', 'As ICS are adopting IT solutions to promote \\ncorporate business systems connectivity and remote access capabilities, and are being designed and \\nimplemented  using industry standard computers, operating systems (OS) and network protocols, they are \\nstarting to resemble IT systems.', 'This integration supports new IT capabilities, but it provides significantly \\nless isolation for ICS from the outside world than pred ecessor systems, creating a greater need to secure \\nthese systems.', 'While security solutions have been designed to deal with these security issues in typical IT \\nsystems, special precautions must be taken when introducing these same solutions to ICS environme nts.', 'In some cases, new security solutions are needed that are tailored to the ICS environment.', 'Although some characteristics are similar, ICS also have characteristics that differ from traditional \\ninformation processing systems.', 'Many of these differences stem from the fact that logic executing in ICS \\nhas a direct effect  on the physical world.', 'Some of these characteristics include significant risk to the \\nhealth and safety of human lives and serious damage to the environment, as well as serious financial \\nissues such as production losses, negative impact to a nation’s economy, and compromise of proprietary \\ninformation.', 'ICS have unique performance and reliability requirements and often use operating systems \\nand applications that may be considered unconventional  to typical IT personnel.', 'Furthermore, the goals of \\nsafety and efficiency sometimes conflict with security in the design and operation of control systems.', 'Originally, ICS implementations were susceptible primarily to local threats because many of their \\ncomponents were in physically secured areas and the components were not connected to IT networks or \\nsystems.', 'However, the trend toward integrating ICS systems with IT networks provides significantly less \\nisolation for ICS from the outside world than predecess or systems, creating a greater need to secure these \\nsystems from remote, external threats.', 'Also, the increasing use of wireless networking places ICS \\nimplementations at greater risk from adversaries who are in relatively close physical proximity but do not  \\nhave direct physical access to the equipment.', 'Threats to control systems can come from numerous \\nsources, including hostile governments, terrorist groups, disgruntled employees, malicious intruders, \\ncomplexities, accidents, and natural disasters as well as  malicious or accidental actions by insiders.', 'ICS \\nsecurity objectives typically follo w the priority of availability and integrity, followed by confidentiality .', 'SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82, REVISION 2 DRAFT                    GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS)  SECURITY  \\n 2 Possible incidents an ICS may face include

objectives for an ICS implementation should include the following:  \\n\\uf03c Restricting logical access to the ICS network and network activity.', 'This includes using a \\ndemilitarized zone (DMZ) network architecture with firewalls to prevent network traffic from passing \\ndirectly between the corporate and ICS networks, and having separate authentication mechanisms and \\ncredentials for users of the corporate and ICS networks.', 'The ICS should also use a network topology \\nthat has multiple layers, with the most critical communications occurring in the most secure and \\nreliable layer.', '\\uf03c Restricting physical access to the ICS network  and devices.', 'Unauthorized physical access to \\ncomponents could cause serious disruption of the ICS’s functionality.', 'A combination of physical \\naccess controls should be used, such as locks, card readers, and/or guards.', '\\uf03c Protecting individual ICS components from exploitation.', 'This includes deploying security patches \\nin as expeditious a manner as possible, after testing them under field conditions; disabling all unused \\nports and services; restricting ICS user privileges to only those that are required for each  person’s \\nrole; tracking and monitoring audit trails; and using security controls such as antivirus software and \\nfile integrity checking software where technically feasible to prevent, deter, detect, and mitigate \\nmalware.', '\\uf03c Maintaining functionality during adverse conditions.', 'This involves designing the ICS so that each \\ncritical component has a redundant counterpart.', 'Additionally, if a component fails, it should fail in a \\nmanner that does not generate unnecessary traffic on the ICS  or other networks , or does  not cause \\nanother problem elsewhere, such as a cascading event.', '\\uf03c Restoring system after an incident.', 'Incidents are inevitable  and an incident response plan is \\nessential .', 'A major characteristic of a good security program is how quickly a system can be recov ered \\nafter an incident has occurred.', 'To properly address security in an ICS, it is essential for a cross -functional cybersecurity  team to share \\ntheir varied domain knowledge and experience to evaluate and mitigate risk to the ICS.', 'The cybersecurity  \\nteam sh ould consist of a member of the organization’s IT staff,

(e.g., facility superintendent) or the company’s CIO/CSO, who in turn, \\naccepts  complete responsibility and accountability for the  cybersecurity  of the ICS.', 'An effective \\ncybersecurity

components \\n(e.g., electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic) that  act together to achieve an industrial objective \\n(e.g., manufacturing, transportation of matter or energy).', 'The part of the system primarily concerned with \\nproducing the output is referred to as the process.', 'The control part of the system includes the spec ification \\nof the desired output or performance.', 'Control can be fully automated or may include a human in the loop.', 'Systems can be configured to operate open -loop, closed -loop, and manual mode.', 'In open -loop control \\nsystems the output is controlled by establ ished settings.', 'In closed -loop control systems , the output has an \\neffect on the input in such a way as to maintain the desired objective.', 'In manual mode the system is \\ncontrolled completely by humans.', 'The part of the system primarily concerned with maintain ing \\nconformance with specifications is referred to as the controller (or control).', 'A typical ICS may contain \\nnumerous control loops, Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs), and remote diagnostics and maintenance \\ntools built using an array of network protocols.', 'IC S control industrial processes are typically used in \\nelectrical, water and wastewater, oil and natural gas, chemical, transportation, pharmaceutical, pulp and \\npaper, food and beverage, and discrete manufacturing (e.g., automotive, aerospace, and durable go ods) \\nindustries.', 'ICS are critical to the operation of the U.S. critical infrastructures that are often highly interconnected and \\nmutually dependent systems.', \"It is important to note that approximately 90 percent of the nation's critical \\ninfrastructures are  privately owned and operated.\", 'Federal agencies also operate many of the industrial \\nprocesses mentioned above as well as air traffic control.', 'This section provides an overview of SCADA, \\nDCS, and PLC systems, including typical topologies and components.', 'Several diagrams are presented to \\ndepict the network topology, connections, components, and protocols typically found on each system to \\nfacilitate the understanding of these systems.', 'These examples only attempt to identify notional topology \\nconcepts.', 'Actual i mplementations of ICS may be hybrids that blur the line between DCS and SCADA \\nsystems .', 'Note that the diagrams in this section do not focus on securing ICS.', 'Security architecture and \\nsecurity controls are discussed in Section 5 and Section 6 of this document respectively.', '2.1 Evolution of Industrial Control Systems  \\nMany of today’s ICS evolved from the insertion of IT capabilities into existing physical systems, often \\nreplacing or supplementing physical control mechanisms.', 'For example , embedded digital controls \\nreplaced analog mechanical controls in rotating machines and engines.', 'Improvements in cost -performance \\nhave encouraged this evolution, resulting in many of today’s “smart” technologies such as the smart \\nelectric grid, smart tran sportation, smart buildings, and smart manufacturing.', 'While this increase s the \\nconnectivity and criticality of these systems, it also

on a \\nquantity of ma terial.', 'There is a distinct start and end step to a batch process with the possibility of \\nbrief steady state operations during intermediate steps.', 'Typical batch

industries are very similar in operation, \\nthey are different in some aspects.', 'Manufacturing industries  are usually located within a confined factory \\nor plant -centric area, when compared to geographically dis persed distribution industries.', 'Communications \\nin manufacturing industries are usually performed using local area network (LAN) technologies that are \\ntypically more

can be initiated by a disruption of the \\nmicrowave communications network used for an electric power transmission SCADA system.', 'The lack of \\nmonitoring and control capabilities could cause a large generating u nit to be taken offline, an event that \\nwould lead to loss of power at a transmission substation.', 'This loss could cause a major imbalance, \\ntriggering a cascading failure across the power grid.', 'This could result in large area blackouts that could \\npotentially  affect oil and natural gas production, refinery operations, water treatment systems, wastewater

'Key components include the following:  \\nA typical ICS contains numerous control loops, human interfaces, and remote diagnostics and \\nmaintenance tools built using an array of network protocols on layered netwo rk architectures.', 'A control \\nloop utilizes  sensors , actuators, and controller s (e.g., P LCs) to manipulate some controlled process.', 'A \\nsensor is a device that produces some measurement of some physical property and then sends this \\ninformation as controlled va riables to the controller.', 'The controller interprets the signals and generates \\ncorresponding manipulated variables, based on set points, which it transmits to the actuators .', 'Actuators \\nsuch as control valves, breakers, switches , and motors  are used to direc tly manipulate the controlled \\nprocess based on commands from the controller.', 'Operators and engineers use human interfaces  to monitor and configure set points, control algorithms, and \\nto adjust and establish parameters in the controller.', 'The human interface  also displays process status \\ninformation and historical information .', 'Diagnostics and maintenance utilities are used to prevent, identify , \\nand recover from abnormal operation or failures.', 'Sometimes these control loops are nested and/or cascading –whereby t he set point for one loop is based \\non the process variable determined by another loop.',

\\ninjury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment”.2 \\nPart of the framing component for an ICS organization is determining how these requirements interact \\nwith information security.', 'For example, if safety requirements conflict with good security practice, how \\nwill the organization decide between the two prioritie s?', 'Most ICS operators would answer that safety is \\nthe main consideration – the framing component makes such assumptions explicit so that there is \\nagreement throughout the process and the

review prior and related work that has been done in this area.', 'The framing component should include review of existing documentation, such as prior risk assessments.', 'There may be related activities, such as community wide disaster management planning that also should \\nbe considered since they impact the requireme nts that a risk assessment must consider.', 'Assessing  risk requires that organizations identify their threats and vulnerabilities, the harm that such \\nthreats and vulnerabilities may cause the organization and the likelihood that adverse events arising from \\nthose threats and vulnerabilities may actually occur.', 'Underlying the assess component is the information \\ndeveloped during the framing step.', 'Identification of threats and vulnerabilities should begin with the identification of reliable sources for \\ninforma tion.', 'Organizations should consider the confidence they place in information sources and then \\ndetermine which should be considered reliable.', 'The sources may vary depending on the purpose and \\nintent of an assessment.', 'For example, an operator doing an assess ment of a single ICS may be able to \\ndetermine that an individual researcher is a reliable source of information for a particular type of \\ntechnology based on past experiences.', 'At a higher level of the organization, a government source may be \\nconsidered more  trusted.', 'Organizations should also review their own past experiences with different \\ninformation sources, as well as vulnerability and threat information developed in prior assessments.', 'Sources for threat and vulnerability information should also be cons idered for the type and quality of \\ninformation that they provide.', 'For example, an information source may give good, credible information \\non threats, but not provide the level of technical detail that makes it possible for an organization to decide \\non an ef fective response.', 'The information source must also present information that is relevant to the \\norganization and its environment.', 'Information sources (especially for threats) that do not apply to the \\nenvironment of the organization should be eliminated from  consideration.', 'Information presented may also \\nnot be actionable because there is n o mitigation available; in this  case, the organization needs to decide \\nwhether to accept the risk or cease the affected function.', 'The analysis of the potential impact to an  organization’s mission from a potential incident must \\nincorporate the effect on the physical process/system, impact on dependent systems/processes, and impact \\non the physical environment among other possibilities.', 'Different components of the ICS support v astly \\ndifferent system operations and will impact the system accordingly.', 'For example, a potential incident may \\naffect a primary ICS control element, backup systems, or even non -control components, including \\nengineering workstations or connected corporate information systems.', 'To determine the impact of \\npotential incidents, ICS owners must understand all ramifications of an incident, including potential \\neffects on interdependent systems.', 'One type of incidents that may have profound impact on the ICS woul d be the degradation of the ability \\nto control or monitor operations.', 'If an ICS component responsible for controlling some physical element \\nwas affected, it could negatively impact the system, process or environment by transmitting extraneous \\ncontrol command s, failing to provide commands when needed, or sending correct commands with \\nundesirable delays.', 'In addition to the control components, many ICS components are deployed to \\nspecifically monitor some physical process and report its status.', 'Therefore, an inci dent affecting one of \\nthese components could potentially result in the status from the physical system being incorrect or \\nunavailable.', 'If this occurs, necessary response/control actions may not occur to prevent undesirable \\nphysical events from occurring.', 'When considering potential impacts from possible incidents, owners and \\noperators of ICS need to think broadly.', 'The final part of assessing risk is determining the likelihood that a particular incident will actually occur.', 'When specific and credible threat data is available (e.g., types of cyber incidents, incident trends, and SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82, REVISION 2 DRAFT                    GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS)

frequency.', 'However, in some cases, such an \\napproach may not work.', 'For example , if there is threat information that relates to a specific adversary and \\nactivity, the organization may need to consult with outside experts to determine the likelihood of \\noccurrence.', 'Organizations should select methods assessing likelihood consistent w ith organizational culture and risk \\ntolerance.', 'To determine the likelihood of threats exploiting vulnerabilities, organizations can employ a \\nvariety of approaches, such as:  \\n \\n\\uf03c Threat assumptions (e.g., historical

\\nidentification  of risk.', 'Response to identif ication of risk (as opposed to the response to an incident) \\nrequires that organizations first identify possible courses of actions to address risk, evaluate those \\npossibilities in light of the organization’s risk tolerance and other considerations determin ed during the \\nframing step, and choose the best alternative for the organization.', 'Finally, the response component \\nincludes the implementation of the chosen course of action to address the identified risk.', 'An organization has a variety of options on how it  responds to an identified risk.', 'It may choose to \\nmitigate , share , transfer  or accept  the risk or any combination of those options.', '\\uf03c Mitigation  is when an organization takes action to reduce an identifi ed risk to an acceptable level.', 'For example, an organ ization may require certain authentication procedures to mitigate the risk of \\nunauthori zed access to a control system.', '\\uf03c Transfer  is when an organization mitigates risk by removing part of the effect (generally monetary) \\nto another entity.', 'By purchasing ins urance to cover the price of failure of availability, an organi zation \\nmight transfer the risk.', '\\uf03c Sharing  the risk is wh en an organization enters into agreements  that may allow an organization  to \\nshare or mitigate a risk or its effects.', 'An example is  when ut ilities enter into agreements to “loan” line \\nworkers in an emergency which reduces the duration of the effect of an incident to acceptable levels.', '\\uf03c Acceptance  is when an organization may choose to simply accept the risk that an incident may \\nhappen.', 'If that  is the case, the organization must be careful to fully document the decision including \\nthe potential outcome.', 'Monitoring  is the fourth component of the risk management activities.', 'Organizations must monitor risk \\non an on -going basis including: the implem

likelihood of an incident is greater than calculated, this \\ninformation needs  to be addressed in the response component.', 'Similarly, monitoring provides validation \\nof the decisions made throughout the risk management process to the organization.', '3.3 Risk Management Framework  \\nOrganizations have flexibility to determine how best to cond uct risk management activities, including the \\nsequence, degree of rigor, formality, and how the results or outputs of each activity are captured and \\nshared across the organization and with other organizations.', 'Organizations may use a

OPC, which utilizes \\nDCOM, dynamically opens a wide range of ports (1024 to 65535) that can be extremely difficult to filter \\nat the firewall.', 'This protocol should only be allowed between control network and DMZ networks and \\nexplic itly blocked between the DMZ and corporate network.', 'Also, users are advised to restrict the port \\nranges used by making registry modifications on devices using DCOM.', '5.8.8  SCADA and Industrial Protocols  \\nSCADA and industrial protocols, such as MODBUS/TCP, EtherNet /IP, and DNP39, are critical for \\ncommunications to most control

service where IP addresses used on one side of a network device \\ncan be mapped to a different set on the other side on an as -needed basis.', 'It was originally designed for IP \\naddress reduction purposes so that an organization with a large number of devices that occasionally \\nneeded Internet access could get by with a smaller set of assi gned Internet addresses.', 'To do this, most NAT  implementations  rely on the premise that not every internal device is actively \\ncommunicating with external hosts at a given moment.', 'The firewall is configured to have a limited \\nnumber of outwardly visible IP ad dresses.', 'When an internal host seeks to communicate to an external \\nhost, the firewall remaps the internal IP address and port to one of the currently unused, more

address and source port was remapped \\nonto an outwardly visible IP address/port pair.', 'When returning traffic reaches the firewall, the mapping is \\nreversed and the pac kets forwarded to the

then a NAT \\nfirewall will substitute (and track) a 192.6.yyy.zzz source address into every outbound IP packet \\ngenerated by a control network device.', 'Producer -consumer protocols, such as EtherNet/IP and Foundation Fieldbus, are particularly troublesome \\nbecause NAT does not support the multicast -based traffic that these protocols need to offer their full \\nservices.', 'In general, whil e NAT offers some distinct advantages, its impact on the actual industrial protocols and \\nconfiguration should be assessed carefully before it is deployed.', 'Furthermore, certain protocols are \\nspecifically broken by NAT because of the lack of direct addressin g. For example, OPC requires special \\nthird -party tunneling software to work with NAT.', '5.10 Specific ICS Firewall Issues  \\nIn addition to the issues with firewalls and ICS already discussed, there are some additional problems that \\nneed to be examined in more detai l. The rest of this section discusses three specific areas of concern: the \\nplacement of data historians, remote access for ICS support, and multicast traffic.', '5.10.1  Data Historians  \\nThe existence of shared control network/corporate network servers such as data hi storians and asset \\nmanagement servers can have a significant impact on firewall design and configuration.', 'In three -zone \\nsystems the placement of these servers in a DMZ is relatively straightforward, but in two -zone designs the \\nissues become complex.', 'Placin g the historian on the corporate side of the firewall means that a number of \\ninsecure protocols, such as MODBUS/TCP or DCOM, must be allowed through the firewall and that \\nevery control device reporting to the historian is exposed to the corporate side of t he network.', 'On the \\nother hand, putting the historian on the control network side means other equally questionable protocols, \\nsuch as HTTP or SQL, must be allowed through the firewall, and there is now a server accessible to \\nnearly everyone in the organizat ion sitting on the control network.', 'In general, the best solution is to avoid two -zone systems (no DMZ) and use a three -zone design, placing \\nthe data collector in the control network and the historian component in the DMZ; however, even this can \\nprove prob lematic in some situations.', 'Heavy access from the large numbers of users on the corporate \\nnetwork to a historian in the DMZ may tax the firewall’s throughput capabilities.', 'One potential solution is \\nto install two servers: one on the control network to coll ect data from the control devices, and a second on \\nthe corporate network mirroring the first server and supporting client queries.', 'The issue of how to time \\nsynchronize both historians will have to be addressed.', 'This also requires a special hole to be put t hrough \\nthe firewall to allow direct server -to-server communications, but if done correctly, this poses only minor \\nrisk.', '5.10.2  Remote Support Access  \\nAnother issue for ICS firewall design is user and/or vendor remote access into the control network.', 'Any \\nusers acce ssing the control network from remote networks should be required to authenticate using an \\nappropriately strong mechanism such as token -based authentication.', 'While it is possible for the controls \\ngroup to set up their own remote access system with multi -factor authentication on the DMZ, in most \\norganizations it is typically more efficient to use existing systems set up by the IT department.', 'In this case \\na connection through the firewall from the IT remote access server is needed.', 'SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82, REVISION 2 DRAFT                    GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS)  SECURITY  \\n 5-20 Remote support personnel co nnecting over the Internet or via dialup modems should use an encrypted \\nprotocol, such as running a corporate VPN connection client, application server , or secure HTTP access, \\nand authenticate using a strong mechanism, such as a token based multi -factor  authentication scheme, in \\norder to connect to the general corporate network.', 'Once connected, they should be required to \\nauthenticate a second time at the control network firewall using a strong mechanism, such as a token \\nbased multi -factor  authentication sch eme, to gain access to the control network.', 'For organizations that do \\nnot allow any control traffic to traverse the corporate network in the clear, this could require a cascading, \\nor secondary tunneling solutions, to gain access to the control network, suc h as a  Secure Sockets L ayer \\n(SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) VPN inside an IPsec VPN.', '5.10.3  Multicast Traffic  \\nMost industrial producer -consumer (or publisher -subscriber) protocols operating over Ethernet, such as \\nEtherNet/IP and Foundation Fieldbus HSE, a re IP multicast -based.', 'The first advantage of IP multicasting \\nis network efficiency; by not repeating the data transmission to the multiple destinations, a significant \\nreduction in network load can occur.', 'The second advantage is that the sending host need not be concerned \\nwith knowing every IP address of every destination host listening for the broadcast information.', 'The \\nthird, and perhaps most important for industrial control purposes, is that a single multicast message offers \\nfar better capabilities for t ime synchronization between multiple control devices than multiple unicast \\nmessages.', 'If the source and destinations of a multicast packet are connected with no intervening routers or firewalls \\nbetween them, the multicast transmission is relatively seamless .', 'However, if the source and destinations \\nare not on the same LAN, forwarding the multicast messages to a destination becomes more complicated.', 'To solve the problem of multicast message routing, hosts need to join (or leave) a group by informing the \\nmultic ast router on their network of the relevant group ID through the use of the Internet Group \\nManagement Protocol (IGMP).', 'Multicast routers subsequently know of the members of multicast groups \\non their network and can decide whether or not to forward a receiv ed multicast message onto their \\nnetwork.', 'A multicast routing protocol is also required.', 'From a firewall administration perspective, \\nmonitoring and filtering IGMP traffic becomes another series of rule sets to manage, adding to the \\ncomplexity of the firewal l. \\nAnother firewall issue related to multicasting is the use of NAT.', 'A firewall performing NAT that receives \\na multicast packet from an external host has no reverse mapping for which internal group ID should \\nreceive the data.', 'If IGMP -aware, it could broadc ast it to every group ID it knows about, because  one of \\nthem will be correct, but this could cause serious issues if an unintended control packet were broadcast to \\na critical node.', 'The safest action for the firewall to take is to drop the packet.', 'Thus, mul ticasting is \\ngenerally considered NAT -unfriendly.', '5.11 Single Points of Failure  \\nSingle points of failure can exist at any level of the ANSI/ISO stack.', 'An example is PLC control of safety \\ninterlocks.', 'Because  security is usually being added to the ICS environment , an eval uation should be done \\nto identif y potential failure points and a risk assessment done to evaluate each point’s exposure.', 'Remediation methods can then be postulated and evaluated and a “risk versus reward” determination \\nmade and design and implemen tation done.', 'SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82, REVISION 2 DRAFT                    GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS)  SECURITY  \\n 5-21 5.12 Redundancy and Fault Tolerance  \\nICS components or networks that are classified as critical to the organization have high availability \\nrequirements.', 'One method of achieving high availability is through the use of redundancy.', 'Additionally, \\nif a component fails, it should fail in a manner that does not generate unnecessary traffic on the ICS, or \\ndoes not cause another problem elsewhere, such as a cascading event.', 'The control system should have the ability to execute an appropriate fail -safe proce ss upon the loss of \\ncommunications with the ICS or the loss of the ICS itself.', 'The organization should define what \"loss of \\ncommunications\" means (e.g., 5 seconds, 5 minutes, etc.', 'without communications).', 'The organization \\nshould then , based on potential co nsequences, define the appropriate fail -safe process for their industry.', 'Backups should be performed using the “backup -in-depth” approach, with layers of backups (e.g., local, \\nfacility, disaster) that are time -sequenced such that rapid recent local backup s are available for immediate \\nuse and secure backups are available to recover from a massive security incident.', 'A mixture of \\nbackup/restore approaches and storage methods should be used to ensure that backups are rigorously \\nproduced, securely stored, and a ppropriately accessible for restoration.', '5.13 Preventing Man -in-the-Middle Attacks  \\nA man-in-the-middle  attack requires knowledge of the protocol being manipulated.', 'The Address \\nResolution Protocol (ARP)  man-in-the-middle  attack is a popular method for an adversa ry to gain access \\nto the network flow of information on a target system.', 'This is performed by attacking the network ARP \\ncache tables of the controller and the workstation machines.', 'Using the compromised computer on the \\ncontrol network, the adversary poison s the ARP tables on each host and informs them that they must \\nroute all their traffic through a specific IP and hardware address (i.e., the adversary’s machine).', 'By \\nmanipulating the ARP tabl es, the adversary can insert their  machine between the two target machines \\nand/or devices.', 'The ARP man-in-the-middle  attack works by initiating gratuitous ARP commands to confuse each host \\n(i.e., ARP poisoning).', 'These ARP commands cause each of the two target hosts to use the MAC address \\nof the adversary as the address for the other target host.', 'When a successful man-in-the-middle attack is \\nperformed, the hosts on each side of the attack are unaware that their network data is taking a different \\nroute through the adversary’s computer.', 'Once an adversary has successfully i nserted their machine into the information stream, they now have full \\ncontrol over the data communications and could carry out several types of attacks.', 'One possible attack \\nmethod is the replay attack.', 'In its simplest form, captured data from the control/H MI is modified to \\ninstantiate activity when received by the device controller.', 'Captured data reflecting normal operations in \\nthe ICS could be played back to the operator as required.', 'This would cause the operator’s HMI to appear \\nto be normal and the attack  will go unobserved.', 'During this replay attack the adversary could continue to \\nsend commands to the controller and/or field devices to cause an undesirable event while the operator is \\nunaware of the true state of the system.', 'Another attack that could be c arried out with the man-in-the-middle attack is sending false messages to \\nthe operator, and could take the form of a false negative or a false positive.', 'This may cause the operator to \\ntake an action, such as flipping a breaker, when it is not required, or it may cause the operator to think \\neverything is fine and not take an action when an action is required.', 'The adversary could send commands \\nto the operator’s console indicating a system change, and when the operator follows normal procedures \\nand attempts to  correct the problem, the operator’s action could cause an undesirable event.', 'There are SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82, REVISION 2 DRAFT                    GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS)  SECURITY  \\n 5-22 numerable variations of the modification and replay of control data which could impact the operations of \\nthe system.', 'Protocol manipulation and the man-in-the-middle at tack are among the most popular ways to manipulate \\ninsecure protocols, such as those found in control systems.', 'However, there are mitigation techniques [36] \\nthat can be applied to secure the systems through MAC address locking, static tables, encryption, and \\nmonitoring.', '\\uf03c MAC Address Locking - The ARP man-in-the-middle attack requires the adversary to be connected \\nto the local network or have control of a local computer on the network.', 'Port security, also called \\nMAC address locking, is one method to secure the physical connection at the end of each port on a \\nnetwork switch.', 'High-end corporate class network switches usually have some kind of option for \\nMAC address locking.', 'MAC address locking is very effective agains t a rogue individual looking to \\nphysically plug into the internal network.', 'Without port security, any open network jack on the wall \\ncould be used as an avenue onto the corporate network.', 'Port security locks a specific MAC address to \\na specific port on a ma naged switch.', 'If the MAC address does not match, the communication link is \\ndisabled and the intruder will not be able to achieve their goal.', 'Some of the more advanced switches \\nhave an auto resetting option, which will reset the security measure if the orig inal MAC is returned to \\nthe port.', 'Although port security is not attacker proof, it does add a layer of added security to the physical \\nnetwork.', 'It also protects the local network from employees plugging un -patched and out -of-date \\nsystems onto the protected  network.', 'This reduces the number of target computers a remote adversary \\ncan access.', 'These security measures not only protect against attacks from external networks but \\nprovide added physical protection as well.', '\\uf03c Static Tables – An ICS network that stays r elatively static could attempt to implement statically \\ncoded ARP tables.', 'Most operating systems have the capability to statically code all of the MAC \\naddresses into the ARP table on each computer.', 'Statically coding the ARP tables on each computer \\nprevents the adversary from changing them by sending ARP reply packets to the victim computer.', 'While this technique is not feasible on a large and/or dynamic corporate network, the limited number \\nof hosts on an ICS network could be effectively protected this way.', '\\uf03c Encryption - As a longer term solution, systems should be designed to include encryption between \\ndevices in order to make it very difficult to reverse engineer protocols and forge packets on control \\nsystem networks.', 'Encrypting the communications between dev ices would make it nearly impossible \\nto perform this attack.', 'Protocols that provide strong authentication also provide resilience to man-in-\\nthe-middle attacks.', '\\uf03c Monitoring  - Monitoring for ARP poisoning provides an added layer of defense.', 'There are several \\nprograms available (e.g., ARPwatch) that can monitor for changing MAC addresses through the ARP \\npackets.', 'SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82, REVISION 2 DRAFT                    GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS)  SECURITY  \\n 5-23 5.14 Authentication and Authorization  \\nAn ICS may contain a large number of systems, each of which must be accessed by a variety of users.', 'Performing the  authentication and authorization of these users presents a challenge to the ICS.', 'Managing \\nthese user’s accounts can be problematic as employees are added, removed, and as their roles change.', 'As \\nthe number of systems and users grow, the process of managing  these accounts becomes more \\ncomplicated.', 'The authentication of a user or system is the process of verifying the claimed identity.', 'Authorization, the \\nprocess of granting the user access privileges, is determined by applying policy rules to the authentica ted \\nidentity and other relevant information10.', 'Authorization is enforced by some access control mechanism.', 'The authentication process can be used to control access to both systems (e.g.', 'HMIs, field devic es, \\nSCADA servers) and networks  (e.g., remote substati ons LANs).', 'Authenticat ion and authorization can  be performed either in a distributed or centralized approach.', 'With \\ndistributed authentication and authorization, every system performs these steps on their own.', 'Each system \\nis responsible for storing its ow n set of user accounts, credentials, and roles and performing the \\nidentification and authentication of the user.', 'This approach typically does not require any additional \\ninfrastructure.', 'However, this approach is problematic in that it does not scale well as  the size of the \\nsystem increases.', 'For example, if a user leaves the organization, the corresponding user account must be \\nremoved from each system individually.', 'In contrast to the distributed approach, centralized authentication and authorization systems  are \\ncommonly used to manage larger number of users and accounts.', 'A centralized approach utilizes some \\ncentral authentication system (e.g., Microsoft Active Directory, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol \\n[LDAP]) to store all accounts and manage the authe ntication and authorization of all individuals and \\nsystems.', 'An authentication protocol (e.g., Kerberos , RADIUS, TACACS +) is then used to communicate  \\ndata between the authentication server and the system performing authentication.', 'While a centralized appr oach provides substantially improved scalability, it also presents numerous \\nadditional concerns that may impact its use in ICS environments.', 'The following considerations apply:  \\n \\n\\uf03c Authentication servers create a single system that is responsible for managin g all system accounts and \\nmust be highly secured.', '\\uf03c The authentications server system requires high availability because its failure may prevent users \\nfrom authenticating to

controls for federal information \\nsystems and organizations.', 'The ICS overlay is a partial tailoring of the controls and control baselines in SP \\n800-53, Revision 4, and adds supplementary guidance specific to ICS.', 'The concept of overlays is introduced \\nin Appendix I of SP 800 -53, Revision 4.', 'The ICS overlay is intended to be applicable to all ICS systems in all \\nindustrial sectors.', 'Further tailoring can be performed to  add specificity to a particular sector (e.g., pipeline, \\nenergy).', 'Ultimately, an overlay may be produced for a specific system (e.g., the XYZ

'Duplicating Appendix F of SP 800 -53 would increase the size of \\nthis Appendix by over 65 pages.', 'Therefore, the drafting committee has decided to not duplicate Appendix F. \\nThe reader should have SP 800 -53, Revision 4  available.', 'The authoring team  also considered that this ICS \\noverlay may serve as a model for other ove rlays.', 'Feedback on this Appendix’s  structure would be \\nappreciated , especially in the following areas: the level of abstraction  and whether the examples provided in \\nthe supplemental guidance are sufficient/beneficial for implementation.', 'Since the ICS overlay exists in the context of SP 800 -53, Revision 4, it is important to review that context.', 'SP \\n800-53, Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and

persistence of targeting by attackers).', 'State -of-the-practice security \\ncontrols and control enhancemen ts have been developed and integrated into the catalog addressing s uch areas \\nas:

'To take advantage of the expanded set of securit y and privacy controls, and to give organizations greater \\nflexibility and agility in defending their information systems, the concept of overlays was introduced in this \\nrevision.', 'Overlays provide a structured approach to help organizations tailor security control baselines and \\ndevelop specialized security plans that can be applied to specific missions/business functions, environments \\nof operation, and/or technologies.', 'This specialization approach is important as the number of threat -driven \\ncontrols and cont rol enhancements in the catalog increases and organizations develop risk management \\nstrategies to address their specific protection needs within defined risk tolerances.', 'SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-82,

off.', 'When a measurement reaches the L set point a pump is turned on.', 'For \\nthe attack used for this work falsified \\nmeasurements are sporadi cally sent to the \\nMODBUS client.', 'Both the water tank and gas \\npipeline systems regularly have measurements \\noutside the H and L limits due to a time delay \\nbetween measuring the gas pressure or water tank \\nlevel and sending the command to turn off the pump adding water or gas to the physical process.', 'This makes developing an automated intrusion \\ndetection rule based strictly on the H and L limits difficult.', 'However,

increased beyond a \\nnormal rate.', 'This attack is a special case of attack 8.', 'For example, the falsified responses may \\nindicate a fast rising wate r level or fast decreasing \\ngas

Honeywell Tuners\\nHoneywell offers a “tuning on demand ”controller, Autotune,\\nwhich is not adaptive or continuous.', 'They also offer an adaptivetuner, Accutune, which uses a combination of frequency and\\ntime response analysis plus rule-based expert system techniques\\nto identify the process continually.', 'An enhanced version of thisis, Accutune II, which incorporates a fuzzy logic overshootsuppression mechanism.', 'It provides a “plug-and-play ”tuning\\nalgorithm, which will starts at the touch of a button or through\\nan input response data set identify and tune for any processesincluding integrating processes and those with a dead-time.This speeds up and simpli ﬁes the startup process and allows\\nretuning at any set-point in an “automatic mode.', '”The fuzzy\\nlogic overshoot suppression function operates independentlyfrom Accutune tuning as an add-on.', 'It does not change the\\nPID parameters, but temporarily modi ﬁes the control action to\\nsuppress overshoot.', 'Although this makes the control systemmore complex and dif ﬁcult to analyze, it allows more aggressive\\naction to co-exist with smooth process output.', 'It can be disabled,\\ndepending on the application or user requirements, and should\\nbe unnecessary if the PID controller is set adaptively optimally.', 'E. Yokogawa Modules\\nYokogawa ﬁrst introduced its SUPER CONTROL module\\nover a decade ago.', 'Similar to Honeywell ’s Accutune II, it also\\nuses a fuzzy logic based algorithm to eliminate overshoots,\\nmimicking control expertise of an experienced operator.', 'Itconsists of two main parts, namely, the set-point modi ﬁer and\\nthe set-point selector.', 'The set-point modi ﬁer models the process and functions as\\nan“expert operator ”byﬁrst considering that a PID controller\\nis dif ﬁcult to tune to deliver both a short rise-time and a low\\novershoot.', 'It thus seeks a knowledge base about the process, its\\ndynamics, and any nonlinearity of the process (including load\\nchanges).', 'Then it leads the system into performing perfectly byfeeding arti ﬁcial target set-points into the PID block through the\\nset-point selector.', 'In particular, SUPER CONTROL operates on three modes.', 'Mode 1 is designed for overshoot suppression by observing therate of change when the process output approaches a new targetset-point.', 'It installs “subset points ”as the process output ap-\\nproaches set-point to insure overshoot does not occur.', 'Mode 2\\nis for ensuring high stability at the set-point while sacri ﬁcing\\nsome response time to a set-point change.', 'Mode 3 is for a fasterresponse than Mode 2 to a set-point or load change with somecompromise in stability when a new set-point is entered and as\\nthe process output approaches that change.', 'The process blockis simply the ﬁrst-order lag time with gain model and it simu-\\nlates the PV without any inherent dead time.', 'A functional block\\ndiagram for Modes 2 and 3 is shown in Fig.', '11.', 'If Mode 2 or3 observes any phase shift that has changed from normal oper-ating conditions, it uses the process model to compute a calcu-\\nlated process variable (CPV) and attempts to suppress PV from\\nhunting.', 'The compensation model switches between the mea-sured PV and CPV while the control function block performsthe normal PID computation.', 'It is unclear how the three modes\\nare switched between, but it would be advantageous if this is\\nscheduled automatically.', 'F .', 'Remarks\\nMany PID hardware vendors have made tremendous efforts\\nto provide a built-in tuning facility.', 'Owing to their vast expe-\\nrience on PID control, most manufacturers have incorporatedtheir knowledge base into their algorithms.', 'Current PID con-trol modules provide “tuning on demand ”with upset or “adap-\\ntive tuning ”or both, depending on the model and user settings.', 'Either technique has its advantages and disadvantages.', 'For ex-ample, if using “tuning on demand ”only, the controller needs\\nto be retuned periodically and whenever changes occur in the\\nprocess dynamics.', 'This can be quite tedious and sometimes\\nunder-performance can be too late to notice.', 'Therefore, “tuning\\non demand ”coupled with “gain-scheduling ”could provide an\\nadvantage.', 'If relying on an “adaptive tuner ”only, the range of changes\\nthat can be covered is rather limited and a classical step-response\\nmodel is still needed for determining initial PID settings.', 'Be-fore normal operations may begin, these systems generally re-quire a carefully supervised start-up and testing period.', 'Further,\\nthe more controller parameters the operator needs to select, the\\nmore dif ﬁcult it is to adjust for optimal performance and the\\nlonger it takes to prepare for the operation.', 'Nevertheless, oncethe controller is correctly con ﬁgured, it can constantly monitor\\nthe process and automatically adjust the controller parameters\\nto adapt to changes in the process.', 'The second effort made by many PID hardware vendors ap-\\npears to be incorporating an overshoot suppression function in\\ntheir onboard algorithms.', 'In order to meet multiple objectives\\nhighlighted in Section II-G, they have also added other func-tions to a standard PID algorithm or allowed the user to switchbetween modes.', 'However, these features are not commonly seen\\nin commercial software packages (see Table IV).', 'VI.', 'C\\nONCLUSION\\nPID, a structurally simple and generally applicable control\\ntechnique, stems it success largely from the fact that it just works\\nvery well with a simple and easy to understand structure.', 'Whilea vast amount of research results are published in the literature,there exists a lack of information exchange and analysis.', 'This\\ncan lead to some misunderstanding between academia and in-\\ndustry.', 'For example, there exists no standardization of a genericPID structure for control engineering practice.', 'This is partic-ularly evident with analogue PID controllers being replaced byANG et al.',

in tuning PID controllers.', 'This problem\\nbecomes severe when there are multiple control loops and dif-\\nferent brands or models of PID controllers involved in one appli-cation.', 'These may explain why the argument exists that academ-ically proposed tuning rules do not work well on industrial PID\\ncontrollers, while it is desired that years of research results help\\nindustrial practice more for improved quality and pro ﬁtability.', 'Many PID patents ﬁled so far focus on automatic tuning for\\nprocess control.', 'This starts from conventional or “intelligent ”\\nsystem identi ﬁcation and is more resembled to hardware mod-\\nules.', 'Software packages are mainly focused on of ﬂine simula-\\ntion and have thus a different objective.', 'While automatic tuning\\nis offered in many commercial PID products for multiple op-timality, timeliness continues to pose a challenge.', 'The majordifﬁculty appears in delivering an optimal transient response,\\ndue to dif ﬁculties in setting an optimal derivative term.', 'Hence,\\nmodi ﬁcations to the easy-to-understand PID structure have been\\nmade through the use of arti ﬁcial intelligence so as to suppress\\novershoots.', 'In order to meet multiple objectives, switching be-\\ntween different functional modes has also been offered in PID\\nhardware modules.', 'The present trend in tackling PID tuning problem is to be able\\nto use the standard PID structure to meet multiple design objec-\\ntives over a reasonably range of operations and systems.', 'Stan-\\ndardization or modularization around this structure should alsohelp improve cost-effectiveness of PID control and its mainte-\\nnance.', 'This way, robustly optimal tuning method can be devel-\\noped, as evident in PIDeasy.', 'With the inclusion of system identi-ﬁcation techniques, the entire PID design and tuning process can\\nbe automated and modular building blocks can be made avail-\\nable for timely online application and adaptation.', 'This
